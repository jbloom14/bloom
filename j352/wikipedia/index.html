    <h1>Taylor Swift</h1>
    <p>Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. She is known for her
        genre-spanning discography and songwriting. Her narrative lyrics—often inspired by her personal life—have
        received critical praise and widespread media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to
        Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting contract
        with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her eponymous
        debut studio album arrived in 2006, and its singles "Teardrops on My Guitar" and "Our Song" were successful on
        both country and pop radio.
        She explored country pop on her next albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), whose singles "Love Story",
        "You Belong with Me" and "Back to December" established her as a leading crossover act. Experiments with rock
        and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), spawned the singles "We Are Never Ever Getting
        Back Together", "I Knew You Were Trouble" and "22" that signaled Swift's transition to mainstream pop. She
        eschewed country completely on her synth-pop album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping tracks "Shake It Off",
        "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". Media scrutiny on her private life inspired Reputation (2017), which drew from
        urban sounds. Led by "Look What You Made Me Do", the album made Swift the only act in MRC Data history to have
        four albums each sell over a million copies in a week.
        Departing from Big Machine, Swift signed with Republic Records in 2018 and released her seventh studio album,
        Lover (2019). Veered by the COVID-19 pandemic, she ventured into indie folk and alternative rock styles on her
        2020 albums, Folklore and Evermore, receiving plaudits for their nuanced storytelling. Following a masters
        dispute, Swift released the re-recordings Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version) to universal
        acclaim in 2021. Number-one songs "Cardigan", "Willow" and "All Too Well (10 Minute Version)" made Swift the
        only act to simultaneously debut atop the US Billboard Hot 100 and Billboard 200 charts three times. Besides
        music, she has played supporting roles in films such as Valentine's Day (2010) and Cats (2019), released the
        autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020), and directed the musical films Folklore: The Long Pond
        Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).
        With over 200 million records sold worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Eight of
        her songs have topped the Hot 100, and her concert tours are some of the highest-grossing in history. She has
        received 11 Grammy Awards (including three Album of the Year wins), an Emmy Award, 34 American Music Awards (the
        most for an artist), 29 Billboard Music Awards (the most for a woman) and 58 Guinness World Records, among other
        accolades. She has featured on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015), Billboard's Greatest
        of All Time Artists (2019), the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100 rankings. Having been honored with titles such
        as Woman of the Decade and Artist of the Decade, Swift is regarded as a pop icon owing to her influential
        career, philanthropy, and advocacy for artists' rights and women's empowerment.</p>
