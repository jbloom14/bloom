  <img>https://www.foodista.com/sites/default/files/styles/recype/public/DSC00146.jpeg</img>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <p>
  <ul>6 medium-large apples (4 Honeycrisp & 2 Granny Smith), cored, seeded and roughly chopped
</ul>
  <ul>2/3 cup water</ul>
  <ul>1/4 cup light brown sugar</ul>
  <ul>1/2 cup regular sugar</ul>
  <ul>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</ul>
  <ul>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</ul>
  <ul>pinch ground cloves</ul>
  <ul>pinch sea salt</ul>
  </p>
<h2>Preparation</h2>
<ol>In a large saucepan add the apples, water, brown sugar, regular sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, cloves and salt and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once boiling, reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover and cook apples for about 20-25 minutes or until apples begin to soften and fall apart.</ol>
<ol>Remove from heat and allow to cool slightly. Once cool enough to handle, place the apple mixture into a food processor with a blade attachment and pulse on/off till smooth.</ol>
<ol>Return the puree to the saucepan and set over medium-low heat. Gently simmer, stirring regularly to avoid burning, until the apple butter is nice caramel color and thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 1 hour.</ol>
<ol>Transfer to a glass jar or airtight container and keep refrigerated.</ol>
