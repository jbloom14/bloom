                        parking lot as they learned skills and practiced tricks tailored to their skill levels.

                        It was We Skate at UMD’s second “edusk8,” designed to teach new skaters how to become more

                    <p>When Joan Selma Hult was a professor at the University of Maryland’s School of Kinesiology, she
                        and her colleagues spent every lunch break on the tennis courts.

                        In between teaching tennis, track and field, volleyball, and sports history and philosophy
                        classes, Hult carved out time to play her favorite sport — fueled by some friendly trash talk —
                        before changing back into her ‘professor clothes,’ and continuing on with her day....
